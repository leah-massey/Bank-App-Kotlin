* **Account Numbers:** Account numbers start at 10000 and increase incrementally by 1.
* **Inputs:** Commands are not case-sensitive.
* **Names:** Names can contain various characters (numbers, hyphen, etc.). The application does not identify name typos. Double-barrelled names should be separated by a hyphen (e.g., `Mary-Jane`).
